- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
Many existing applications use class components, so it is likely we will run into class components at work and need to maintain or update them.
- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
Constructor: brings in state, add initial value
Render: prints code to the browser
ComponentDidMount: runs after component mounts and can act like useEffect, use to setState.

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
To be able to reuse one hook for multiple purposes
- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
To make sure our code works how we expect it to, and find holes in our code that we did not consider initially.
